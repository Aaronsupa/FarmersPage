                <p style="text-indent: 2em;">When we returned home from Scandinavia, it was time to start the Fall 2025 semester. As we planned to assist with the UT orchard, our plans were abruptly stopped because the university already had plans with the orchard space. So, it was time to pivot. We still agreed we wanted to help improve a green space on campus, and the next target we set our eyes on was the old greenhouse near the turtle pond. Unfortunately, after meeting with staff on the matter, we learned it may be too unsafe, so, once again we had to pivot. Next, we turned our attention to organizations on campus that are helping teach students and support green spaces, namely, UT Microfarm and Farmstand. We learned that UT Microfarm is a small scale urban farm that is located on the UT campus. It is a small scale farm that is used to teach students about urban agriculture and sustainable farming practices. It is also a place where students can learn about the food system and how to be sustainable. We learned that UT Farmstand is a small scale farm that is located on the UT campus. It is a small scale farm that is used to teach students about urban agriculture and sustainable farming practices. It is also a place where students can learn about the food system and how to be sustainable.</p>

                <p style="text-indent: 2em">We met with Hillary and Lola Davis to discuss our ideas for collaboration. We had tons of ideas, from seed walls to benches for use, we wanted to try engaging students with the environment. Later, we met with Scott Blackburn, current Garden Program Coordinator, for University Housing and Dining. He informed us of Pick Local, a yearly event by the department which lets students interact with the Jester Garden, pick their own produce, and make a salad while learning a bit more about how food is made. This intrigued us and we wanted to get involved by postering. We still had a month before Pick Local, and in the meantime, we wanted to continue brainstorming on ways we could try improving the Jester Garden space. This led us to creating a short survey and conducting interviews to gain an understanding of students’ perceptions of on-campus green spaces, and how they engage with them. We asked these questions at UT Farmstand Marketplace to the students waiting in line with the help of Lola Davis. From talking to students, we learned that many felt as though they didn’t have enough time to interact with the green spaces or were unaware of them, and the design of the current green spaces on campus may not be conducive to students’ activities.

                <p style="text-indent: 2em">For example, multiple students noted how the Turtle pond does not have any seating, which makes it harder to relax there, and others voiced that some spaces are hard to interact  with because of a lack of shade in the Texas heat. With these student perspectives, we thought again about the Jester Garden space and how we could strengthen its connection to UT students. New seating is a part of the garden’s long term plan, so we figured we could think more about placemaking and a display that students help create. Ella mentioned how UT holds rock painting events frequently, and that could be beneficial to hold during our Pick Local tabling. Additionally, we were inspired by the custom manhole covers in Oslo and thought about making a rock path which would have art from nature. This would serve as a way for students to think more about their surroundings during Pick Local and we could have these rocks on display in the garden to show the space’s connection to the UT community. Due to time constraints, the path itself is a goal of ours for the upcoming year, as the garden is undergoing renovations.</p>

                <p style="text-indent: 2em">At Pick Local, students made their salads and checked out our postering session. We let students know about PAGL and our research, and encouraged them to paint a rock so it can become a part of the garden. As students ate and chatted, they painted their rocks with whatever they had in mind. Some were silly, others nature-inspired, and some just random. More importantly, people expressed how much they enjoyed the event, and most painters left their rocks with us in hopes of seeing them in the garden one day. </p>

                <p style="text-indent: 2em">We closed out the semester by presenting one final Pecha Kucha during PAGL night. We were full of smiles and were incredibly joyous as the year of hard work, new friendships, and learning came to a close.</p>
