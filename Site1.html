                <p style="text-indent: 2em;">Welcome to the story of our group for the President’s Award for Global Learning (PAGL): <i>Cultivating Resilience: A Comparative Study of Urban Agriculture, Technology, 
                    and Resilience in Central Texas and Öresund Scandinavia</i>. We are four University of Texas at Austin (UT) Undergraduate students, Jane Goldberg, majoring in journalism and health & society, Angela Yingchen, majoring in 
                    informatics and studio art, Ella Gault, majoring in arts & entertainment technology, and Aaron Johnson, majoring in computer science.

                        When we began the program, we were incredibly interested in seeing how small scale agricultural practices can help alleviate food insecurity within the city of Austin. As we researched we found that the city’s food insecurity rate is 3.8% above the
                     national average (Eubank, 2022), and learned that urban agriculture is the practice of cultivating food in city spaces. We saw that there were a wide range of practices urban agriculturalists
                      employ, such as vertical farming and community gardens. However, as we did more literature reviews, we saw that the impacts of these practices are not fully apparent in food insecurity at this 
                      very moment, and we began to pivot the scope of our research. We leaned into the comparative aspect of the program and decided to explore the forms of urban agriculture that have appeared in both 
                      the Central Texas and Oresund, Scandinavia regions. So, we decided to ask the questions, <i>“What structures of urban agriculture have developed in Central Texas and Øresund, Scandinavia?”</i>, and, <i>“What 
                      impacts can urban agriculture have on residents of Central Texas and Øresund, Scandinavia, and how can they best be supported to maximize impact?”</i> These questions gave us the opportunities to learn about 
                      current social and political support for urban agriculture initiatives, and understand the potential shortcomings of certain urban agricultural approaches. With these questions in mind, we began to explore Austin…</p>
