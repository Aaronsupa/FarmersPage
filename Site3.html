                <h2>To Scandinavia</h2>

                <p style="text-indent: 2em;">The first location we visited was Oens Have, a farm and restaurant that sits on land with a difficult past. Once industrial, the land is now polluted in ways that make even basic planting a challenge. We learned how they often have to strip away contaminated soil before anything can grow, and how this reality shaped their mission: farming here is as much about teaching as producing. With limited land, they use intensive methods like mushroom cultivation and vertical farming, but they also work hard to stay connected to the community. Many city residents don’t know what grows in their own climate or what real produce tastes like, so the farm partners with schools, hosts volunteer days, and runs a CSA to help people relearn the rhythms of seasons and the value of food. Everything they grow is organic and used on-site, especially in their plant-focused restaurant built around the idea that if you couldn’t kill it, maybe you shouldn’t eat it. They rely on volunteers and school visits for funding because the city provides none, and every building on the farm is technically temporary while they wait to see what urban plans come next.</p>

                <img src="oenshave1.jpeg" alt="Group Photo" class="inline-image">

                <p style="text-indent: 2em;">Despite the uncertainty, the farm is full of life. About 55 people work here, supported by neighboring farms and a community eager to participate in something meaningful, whether that’s a volunteer day, or a shared meal at one of their “dinners on the farm.” The team dreams big even as they face complex challenges around climate change, regulations, and the fragile economics of sustainable food. They talked openly about the contradictions in Denmark’s food system and how high-quality produce is expensive, and how large industries like pork production leave pollution behind while exporting profit elsewhere. 
                </p>

                <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
                    The next day, we had a bike tour of Copenhagen green spaces as a class. We learned that in the city's climate quarter, which is
                    routinely impacted by threats of flooding becuase of how the land is situated, draining water from cloud bursts and heavy rain is
                    a problem that the city is trying to fix. Some main approaches they have taken is climate adaptation, which is using vegetation and undergound
                    channeling to hold and redirect water. Also, any new buildings must have good climate adaptation and rainwater holding capabilities. However,
                    a downside to these approaches is that these new apartments are more expensive because of the added greenery, which can
                    contribute to genrification. We also learned that rooftop gardens are hard to achieve because the structure itself needs to hold the weight of the 
                    garden, and architecturally, this is difficult. It is also difficult for some plants to be implemented in rooftop gardens
                    becuase of the weight limits, such as trees. 
                </p>

                <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
                    In Malmo, the first garden we visited was Botildenborg. The garden was a ways away from the city center, and took a 30 minute bus-ride into
                    the suburb of the city. Botildenborg sits at the intersection of sustainable food production, social innovation, and community, built on the belief that food
                    can bring people together across generations and life experiences. Once an unused building owned by the City of Malmö, the space was transformed
                    by its founder, a former journalist, who wanted to counter negative stereotypes about immigrants and create a meeting place rooted in shared flavors and connection.
                    Today, the farm grows a diverse range of organic produce for its own restaurant and farm shop, focusing on ingredients that support seasonal menus and educational projects. 
                    Every plant in their “social garden” is edible, and the forest garden mimics natural ecosystems while teaching visitors how food grows. Rainwater collection, composting, 
                    and sustainable irrigation reflect their commitment to the UN Sustainable Development Goals, even as they face challenges like funding cycles, infrastructure limitations,
                    and the demand for consistent production with a small staff. They collaborate with universities, municipalities, and international partners to research ecological 
                    and social transitions, making the site a place where theories about sustainability become real, working models.

                </p>
                <p style="text-indent: 2em">
                    Beyond farming, Botildenborg is a hub for social growth and personal transformation. Their refugee and work-training programs, initially funded by EU
                     and city grants, support people who have faced barriers such as injury, depression, long-term unemployment, or displacement from war. Participants spend months 
                     building confidence through kitchen and garden work while learning Swedish and navigating the path back into the workforce; over 70% successfully transition into jobs. 
                     Children and seniors come together in the Friendship Garden to plant, harvest, cook, and share meals, creating spaces for intergenerational learning.
                      The farm also hosts community workshops, school garden programs, and corporate sessions, adapting each project to local needs. 
                     Even with competitive funding, short-term permits, and the ongoing pressure to balance social missions with production demands, the team continues to 
                     build a place where community, sustainability, and belonging grow side by side.

                <p style="text-indent: 2em;">For our final Scandinavian Pecha Kucha, we summarized our key findings into 5 main points:
                </p>

                <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
                    1. Organizations are trying to increase public awareness of sustainable eating practices
                </p>

                <p style="margin-left: 4em;">
                    Organizations here include Malmo city Food Council, which is a third-party organization 
                    that works with the city and offer suggestions for Malmo’s food system development. Yet, it’s
                     not really a city department. We found this a very interesting dynamic as the food council 
                     collaborates with many local producers, restaurants, and individuals. 

                    Their strategy in incentivizing more plant-based eating practices focus on increasing rather than a completely
                    “no”. Coming down to “people level” is the main key. To elaborate more on this, they will suggest participants in 
                    eating more vegetables because of health benefits. By increasing the portion, the consumption of meat therefore reduce
                    in a diet plate. They also suggested using languages that tailor to the listener’s interests. 

                    They also make innovative, diverse, and delicious vegan meals, and who can reject good food?
                </p>

                <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
                    2. Trust leads to more open spaces and encourages community participation
                </p>

                <p style="text-indent: 4em;">
                Spaces are more open in general in terms of:
                    <p style="margin-left: 6em;">Access and has a sense of invitation (i.e. less fences, locks, and some places actually leave their gate open to invite the locals in visiting, sharing, and interacting with the space)</p>
                    <p style="margin-left: 6em;">Municipalities/entities offers communal supplies and resources for planting</p>
                    <p style="margin-left: 6em;">Limited stealing of produces reflects more respect about spaces, efforts, as well as food</p>
                </p>

                <p style="text-indent: 4em;">
                    In general, this openness helps to foster a more inclusive community participation
                </p>

                <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
                    3. Public green education supports a collective commitment in sustainability
                </p>

                <p style="margin-left: 4em;">
                    As seen in the Copenhagen park spaces, public green education helps keep citizens aware of goals in sustainability and
                    the importance of greenery within cities. This helps organizations gain support from citizens and gets people
                    involved in initiatives such as urban agriculture. 
                </p>

                <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
                    4. Gardens can double as a community space and bring people together
                </p>

                <p style="margin-left: 4em;">
                    We've seen how gardens can help bring people together such as Oens Have and have learned about
                    accessability as a barrier for people getting involved in gardening initiatives. Although Thereis the idealized
                    idea that these spaces and bond communities, we've also seen how there is a stratification in the spaces available
                    for people to engage with green spaces. This is in part due to societal differences and social treatment of different
                    marginalized groups.
                </p>

                <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
                    5. Municipal financial support strengthens local gardening efforts
                </p>

                <p style="margin-left: 4em;">
                    In both Scandinavia and Central Texas we have seen how municipal financial support can go a long way for these
                    organizations. Securing grant money has been a pain point for communities in both regions, and changes in 
                    government leadership and policy has major impacts on the activities of these gardening organizations. 

                </p>

                <p style="text-indent: 2em;">After all of our experiences in observational research and interviews, for our final deliverable, we decided to submit proposals to help revamp the UT Orchard space
                    we visited at the beginning of the Spring semester. We wanted to have a continous project that would bring together multiple on-campus organizations and would have the goal of improving mental
                    health and educating visitors on the food system. To achieve this goal, we wanted to incorporate effective signage and have spiral or box gardens that can help reduce needs for 
                    consistant maintenance. Below are some guiding photos we used:
                </p>
